# RSA decryption
Simple Python scripts to help you to decrypt RSA-encrypted data
Decryption attacks:
1. rsa_decrypt_n_p_q_e.py
  A simple Python script which will decrypt RSA data if you know n, p, q and e values
2. rsa_bruteforce_small_e.py
   A simple Python script which will bruteforce RSA for small e values and m^e is barely larger than n
